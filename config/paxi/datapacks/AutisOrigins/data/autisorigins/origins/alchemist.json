    "description": "Often mistaken for a profession, the Alchemists are actually a distinct species from everyday Autists.\nThe Alchemist race has no juveniles, and its method of reproduction is unknown - instead they seem to appear spontaneously in dark alleys and run-down laboratories, gathering wherever densely packed bomb targets can be found.\nEver-mysterious, countless theories guess at where they come from, how they tell each other apart, and how they eat food with a mask on - even an Alchemist's real name is a closely guarded secret. Though they may seem inscrutable or even mad at times, it is said that an Alchemist may reveal their name to a true friend.",
