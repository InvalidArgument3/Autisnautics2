    "name": "Angel",
    "description": "Ancient lore describes Angels as a fearsome host of glimmering celestials, bearing countless eyes and flaming wings. But in time immemorial, this world's link with the heavens was suddenly broken, and the Angels vanished forever.\nAt least, most of them did. Legend states one Angel remained behind, a diminutive cherub of the lowest order. Some claim they were forgotten by their kin; other tales depict a fallen angel tempted by material existence.\nWhatever their lofty origins, the Angel race today are small winged creatures, bearing more resemblance to the meddlesome fairies. Typecast as a flock of hyperactive gremlins, Angels also have a reputation for swooping like seagulls and stealing sweets.",
