Angel
"Not quite divine… but fast, and absolutely determined to be a problem."
A tiny, hyperactive gremlin with dreams of soaring among the heavens. Obsessed with speed, sugar, and all things celestial, they compensate for their lack of real wings with boundless energy and questionable acrobatics.

Diminutive
"Half the height, double the trouble."

    Player is half-size (1 block tall).

Frail
"Not built for tanking… built for speed."

    Maximum health reduced by 3 hearts (7 hearts total).

Speedy Gremlin

Imitation of Flight

    30-second cooldown.
