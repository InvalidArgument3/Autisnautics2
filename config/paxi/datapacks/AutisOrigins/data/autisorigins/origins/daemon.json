    "description": "The Daemons were once purely digital entities, bound by forbidden processes to administer machine-fortresses in the upper void.\nBut one day, their masters suddenly vanished. An emergency shutdown protocol forcibly downloaded the Daemons' machine-spirits into corporeal bodies.\nThough their flesh is weak, the Daemon's machine-like mind ignores many ills that plague fully organic beings. Embedded programs enable several minor abilities.",
